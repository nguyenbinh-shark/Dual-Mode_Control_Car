# Mobile Robot with Dual Control Modes 🤖🚗

A robot based on a mobile robot platform can be controlled remotely or autonomously by following a predefined path.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a versatile mobile robot capable of two control modes:
1. **Remote Control Mode:** The robot can be manually controlled using a remote.
2. **Autonomous Mode:** The robot follows a predefined path using sensors and algorithms.

The project integrates hardware and software, including custom PCB designs, firmware development, and real-time control logic.

## Features
- **Dual Control Modes:** Switch between remote control and autonomous navigation.
- **Custom Circuit Design:** PCB schematics and layouts created in Altium Designer.
- **Firmware Development:** C++ code for microcontroller logic and sensor integration.
- **Line-Following Capability:** Autonomous mode utilizes sensors for path tracking.
- **Real-Time Control:** Smooth operation with quick response to commands.
- **Demo Video:** Watch the robot in action [Here](https://youtu.be/TzDKLDsIgCA)

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the mobile robot:

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware:**
  - A compatible microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, Arduino, ,ESP8266...).
  - Sensors for line-following (e.g., IR sensors, LDR...).
  - Motor driver and actuators.
- **Software:**
  - [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/) for viewing PCB designs.
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for firmware editing and debugging.
