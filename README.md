# Mobile Robot with Dual Control Modes ðŸ¤–ðŸš—

This repository contains the resources and files for a mobile robot platform that can be controlled via a remote or autonomously navigate along a predefined path.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a versatile mobile robot capable of two control modes:
1. **Remote Control Mode:** The robot can be manually controlled using a remote.
2. **Autonomous Mode:** The robot follows a predefined path using sensors and algorithms.

The project integrates hardware and software, including custom PCB designs, firmware development, and real-time control logic.

## Features
- **Dual Control Modes:** Switch between remote control and autonomous navigation.
- **Custom Circuit Design:** PCB schematics and layouts created in Altium Designer.
- **Firmware Development:** C++ code for microcontroller logic and sensor integration.
- **Line-Following Capability:** Autonomous mode utilizes sensors for path tracking.
- **Real-Time Control:** Smooth operation with quick response to commands.
- **Demo Video:** Watch the robot in action.
